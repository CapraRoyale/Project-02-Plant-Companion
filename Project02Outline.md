## Idea:

*A companion-planting app that allows users to easily query helpful pairings and trios of plants for their garden*

## Target Audience:

- *New urban gardeners that need assistance getting started and setting up a garden that's more likely to succeed*

- *Experienced gardeners looking for an easy reference/guide to assist in their process*

## Problem:

According to [Wikipedia]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_planting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_planting))

> **Companion planting** in gardening and agriculture is the planting of different crops in proximity for any of a number of different reasons, including [pest control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_control "Pest control"), [pollination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollination "Pollination"), providing [habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat "Habitat") for [beneficial insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficial_insect "Beneficial insect"), maximizing use of space, and to otherwise increase [crop productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_productivity "Crop productivity").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_planting#cite_note-mcclure-1) Companion planting is a form of [polyculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyculture "Polyculture").

*Companion-planting is an age-old method of growing plants, primarily food crops, that benefit each other by fixing nutrients in the soil, attracting pollinators & beneficial organisms, providing shade and structure and other benefits.*

*The wisdom of companion planting is primarily passed through intergenerational word-of-mouth, shared among families with large plots of land often used for agricultural purposes, like farming and more recently, gardening.*

*Unfortunately, for many city-dwellers, living without intergenerational family in close-proximity, in non-agricultural settings and often without any proper land to grow in, it can be difficult to know where to start and how to plant for food and pleasure in a way that's more likely succeed*

## Goal:

*To provide a simple-to-use resource for improving the results of gardening, regardless of the user's experience in gardening, agriculture, or food crop production.*

*The app would provide launch-points for users not sure where to start:*

- *What plants grow best this time of year in your region*

- *What types of foods you like and the plants that help compose them*

- *Best options for growing indoors and outdoors*

#### User Stories:

* As a user, it's easy for me to brainstorm possible planting ideas with ***Plant Companion***
* Using ***Plant Companion*** I can plant with greater confidence, knowing my plants will help each other grow
* Living in the city and having a small patio, ***Plant Companion*** lets me optimize my growing outcomes for food production and house plants.

#### Concept 'Nice-to-Haves':

* Resource links for Local Community Gardens available to grow in.
* Resources for buying seeds and starts.
* Ideal plants to grow in your area to attract certain wildlife.
* Keep track of "Date of plant" in order to create simple schedules for watering, fertilizing, pruning, weeding and harvesting.
* USDA Plant Hardiness Guide reference to ident

#### Rough Sketch:

## Alternate Idea:

* Plot Planner: Use satelite imagery and local images to create a visually-concise reference map that users can then tag, markup and draw on, in order to mark the seeds and starts they've planted to keep track of growth progress as well as create schedules for watering, fertilizing, weeding and harvesting.
